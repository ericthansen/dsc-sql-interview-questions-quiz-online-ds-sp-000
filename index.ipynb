    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",

    "A primary key of a table is a unique identifier for a given row of that table.  Foreign keys are columns of other tables that may not be unique but establishes a relationship between a given table and another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One to one, one to many, many to many.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "In SQL in general, right, left, combined with inner/outer.  Depending on needs, can pull all rows of both tables, all rows in just one, or only rows that exist in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Any variable that is being aggregrated should have an accompanying variable by which it is grouped.  I.e. the group by variable(s) determine the collections by which the aggregations are grouped.  \n",
    "E.g., one could aggregate total $ spent on orders by customer, or by salesperson, or all $ spent for entire company; each would entail a different way of grouping $ spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associative Entities act to connect tables that don't have any keys in common necessarily, but may be connected through an intermediate table.\n",
